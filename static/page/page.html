              To answer this question, we first need to understand how Webpack deals with static assets. In *.vue components, all your templates and CSS are parsed by vue-html-loader and css-loader to look for asset URLs. For example, in and background: url(./logo.png), "./logo.png" is a relative asset path and will be resolved by Webpack as a module dependency.
              Because logo.png is not JavaScript, when treated as a module dependency, we need to use url-loader and file-loader to process it. This boilerplate has already configured these loaders for you, so you basically get features such as filename fingerprinting and conditional bas64 inlining for free, while being able to use relative/module paths without worrying about deployment.
              Since these assets may be inlined/copied/renamed during build, they are essentially part of your source code. This is why it is recommended to place Webpack-processed static assets inside /src, along side other source files. In fact, you don't even have to put them all in /src/assets: you can organize them based on the module/component using them. For example, you can put each component in its own directory, with its static assets right next to it.
